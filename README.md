## Assignment
Your assignment is to create an application page for one of Netwervenâ€™s clients that features a form that will allow the applicant to enter his or her personal details, provide a motivational letter and upload his or her CV.

Therefore, make sure that you have enabled which allows the use of your e-mail for unverified application at this link (https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

- Enjoy!
